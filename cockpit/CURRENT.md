# Cockpit Home CURRENT

> **STATUS:** COCKPIT HOME V1 RELEASE COMPLETE / PR #118 MERGED / RENDER LIVE / ROOT SMOKE VERIFIED.
> **Workstream:** Clinical Excellence Cockpit Home v1.
> **Branch:** feat/cockpit-home-v1-2026-09-27.
> **Base main:** 88ad125f0a25a471b0151eeb26e68b8b8a93c84f.
> **Exact tested head:** 7744e2142b54ba0b7c8b92c87e4e511cffffc26b.
> **Root writer lock:** unchanged; PR-1 Heidi-first transcript capture remains the repo-wide CURRENT_OPERATIONAL owner.
> **Overlap:** none; this slice is limited to global Cockpit navigation/home presentation and Osteoporosis sidebar cleanup.

## Product-owner decisions

- / must open the global Cockpit Home, not the Osteoporosis module.
- Osteoporosis is Module 01 / proving ground, not the whole Cockpit.
- Osteoporosis sidebar must contain only Module-01 navigation.
- Global Clinic Utilities belong on Cockpit Home.
- The duplicate physiotherapy referral entry must collapse to one global tool entry.
- The top-level Heidi AI navigation item must be removed from Osteoporosis; Heidi remains an encounter-capture capability inside the Module-01 workflow and future reusable Core.
- The separate Reception/calls dashboard remains owned by ortho-reception-backend-v2; Cockpit Home links to it rather than duplicating its implementation.
- Calendar/Cal.com reason ingestion is a separate follow-up integration slice because its source-of-truth boundary spans repositories.

## Home v1 information architecture

Cockpit Home
- Today
  - Clinical Calendar
- Clinical Modules
  - Osteoporosis · Module 01 · Active
- Learning & Improvement
  - Clinical Learning Hub
- Clinic Utilities
  - Παραπεμπτικό Φυσιοθεραπείας
  - Αναρρωτική άδεια
  - Ιατρικές εκθέσεις
  - Ραδιοκύματα
- Reception
  - Call / Reception dashboard (external owner)

Module 02+ appear as future placeholders only; no fake runtime is implied.

## Safety / scope

- no patient/clinical data model change;
- no Cal.com/Setmore/Digital Secretary mutation in this slice;
- no PR-1 transcript runtime mutation;
- no duplicate copy of the Reception dashboard;
- no new browser patient persistence;
- root Clinical Auth boundary remains unchanged.

## Verification

Cockpit Home gate:

run: 36273987676
head: 7744e2142b54ba0b7c8b92c87e4e511cffffc26b
result: SUCCESS
```

Verified:

- Python syntax PASS;
- Cockpit browser JavaScript syntax PASS;
- 4 deterministic Cockpit Home tests PASS;
- Osteoporosis G4 workspace/navigation regression PASS;
- diff hygiene PASS.

Behavior proven:

- / enters /static/cockpit/;
- global Cockpit Home contains Modules, Calendar, Learning, Clinic Utilities and Reception;
- Clinic Utilities are absent from the Osteoporosis sidebar;
- top-level Heidi AI is absent from the Osteoporosis sidebar;
- one global physiotherapy referral entry exists;
- Home calendar summary uses aggregate counts only and does not render patient identity fields.

Final PR exact head `ba2de644f4fd16e70d12f04831b28f5fd42730ec` passed all 16 checks, including Cockpit Home, Canonical Impact, G3/G2/G1, Clinical Learning L1/L1B/L1C, Clinical Documents, CU-1 and Physio inherited browser gates.

Released navigation ownership:

- global Clinic Utilities live only on Cockpit Home;
- Osteoporosis remains Module 01 and no longer owns the general utilities group;
- top-level Heidi AI navigation is absent from the Osteoporosis sidebar;
- Heidi capture/exposure content remains inside the Module-01 encounter workflow;
- exactly one global physiotherapy referral entry is exposed on Home;
- Reception remains a linked separately-owned system.

## Current release state

```text
IMPLEMENTED: YES
TESTED: YES
PR #118: MERGED
DEPLOYED: YES / LIVE
ROOT -> COCKPIT HOME: VERIFIED
MODULE-01 SIDEBAR CLEANUP: VERIFIED
CAL.COM REASON BRIDGE: CONSUMER MERGED / PRODUCER PENDING
```

## Exact next action

HOLD this completed Home release. The Clinical Calendar consumer side of the separate Cal.com visit-reason integration is now merged; the Reception producer remains separately gated. Do not reopen Cockpit Home unless post-use evidence shows a presentation/navigation defect.

# Clinical Calendar reason bridge — bounded follow-up slice

> **STATUS:** CONSUMER SNAPSHOT MERGED / CROSS-REPO COMPATIBILITY PASS / PRODUCER PR #152 PENDING.
> **Workstream:** Cal.com visit-reason normalization into the Clinical Calendar.
> **Branch:** `feat/calendar-reason-snapshot-v1-2026-09-27`.
> **Base main:** `a0cf912b0fcb5caf54f4a48f8f8a698908fbb0a4`.
> **Product-owner resume:** 2026-09-27 — continue the exact follow-up slice named above after recovery from the interrupted PR1 Βελτιώσεις Eval conversation.
> **Root writer lock:** unchanged; PR-1 Heidi-first transcript capture remains the repo-wide CURRENT_OPERATIONAL owner.
> **Overlap:** none; this branch is limited to the Clinical Calendar integration contract and its tests/docs. It does not mutate PR-1 transcript runtime.

## Accepted boundary

- Cal.com remains the appointment-source truth for the feed.
- Reception/Digital Secretary remains the external integration owner; no Cal API credential is added to this repository.
- Clinical Calendar remains the normalized clinical consumer.
- This slice is read-only with respect to bookings: it must not create, cancel, reschedule or authorize appointments.
- Reception reason-triage / availability / booking semantics are explicitly out of scope.
- The existing Clinical Calendar classifier is reused; no second semantic reason owner is introduced.
- Snapshot reconciliation must remove stale source rows inside the declared source/time window so cancellations/reschedules do not remain as phantom appointments.
- Raw provider payloads are not persisted; only the existing normalized appointment fields are stored.

## Current implementation order

1. **DONE / MERGED:** bounded server-to-server snapshot ingest contract, stale-row reconciliation, normalized reason transport, and source/window validation.
2. **DONE / VERIFIED:** consumer exact head `bbd5c7bca0fd109797fac5a03c15a51f0f53af21` passed workflow `36308943111` with 12 tests plus canonical-impact guard `36308943000`.
3. **DONE:** cross-repository compatibility review against producer PR #152; the DST and snapshot-cardinality blockers were corrected in the consumer and closed PASS.
4. **DONE / MERGED:** PR #119 merged to `main` as `08251120a1743a1ac629e38626d04747a8fda1e9`.
5. **NOW:** preserve the merged consumer contract and proceed only with the separately gated producer #152 release/merge step.
6. Deployment, Cal.com field-key configuration and runtime smoke remain later, separately authorized actions.
